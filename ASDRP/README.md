# ASDRP Projects

The Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program is a research program for high school students around the world, but mostly based in the bay area, 
that publishes research papers on various topics, including computer science, astronomy, biology, chemistry, and psychology.

My role in ASDRP has been primarily geared towards computer science and programming, as well as database management and usage.

So far I have been a part of three projects:

### Grade 10 - first semester: Stock Market Prediction using Genetic Algorithms and Sentiment Analysis of Newspaper headlines
My role in this project was to code the genetic algorithm that would be used in the end. 
However, we did not get around to publishing a research paper, but the code I created is published in the respective folder.

Topics learned:
- Team Organization
- The Nature of Genetic Algorithms
- API Usage, Web Scraping

Programming Languages / Software:
- Python
- SQL

### Grade 10 - second semester: Criminal Prediction of Counties in California using various ML Algorithms on contextual factors
This project was mainly SQL-geared and individual. Since most of my team members were unresponsive, I worked on the data collection, normalization, and training and testing myself. 
My contextual data factors was from datacommons.org and the crime values were from the OpenJustice California Arrests Dataset.

Topics Learned:
- SQL Database Creation
- Data Normalization
- Combining Different Datasets
- The Nature of Machine Learning and the Differences between ML Algorithms

Programming Languages / Software:
- Orange Data Mining Application
- SQL

### Grade 11 - first semester: Finding Mini Black Hole Candidates using Outlier Detection in Exoplanets
I chose to go out of my comfort zone for this project, learning about a topic (astronomy) I have never really studied. I assumed a leadership position in our group of 8 researchers and worked with the team to search for new datasets as part of this continuing research project.

Topics Learned:
- Delegating tasks in leadership settings
- Working with extremely large datasets

Programming Languages / Software:
- Oranga Data Mining Application
- Various forms of SQL
