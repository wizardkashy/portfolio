# Single Cycle RISC-V Processor
- Designed in Verilog HDL using the Vivado IDE
- Arithmetic Logic Unit, Instruction Memory, Immediate Generator, Data Memory lower-level modules connected through Datapath module
- accepts 32-bit RISC-V Processor instructions.


Designed and implemented for EECS 31L: Digital Logic Design at UCI -- A Questionably-led class with very cool course content. From the ground-up learned
how to use Verilog and Vivado to program module behaviors and connect them using wires. Began with smaller-level Multiplexers and FlipFlops, but worked through
ALU and other components to create a functional RISC-V Processor.
