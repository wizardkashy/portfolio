# Academic Talent Development Program
I was a part of the Academic Talent Development Program in my 9th, 11th, and 12th grade summers. Listed are the classes I took and the years.

### Elements of Web Design: 2019 Summer
In this course we learned how to use HTML and CSS to create static webpages, and along the way learned how the internet works and evolved over time.

The final project was a website of our own design, and for this I created a website for a video game group I was a part of at the time, called Bridgers.

### Programming in Java (AP-aligned): 2021 Summer
I learned the principles of Object Oriented programming through Java.

### Web Development: 2022 Summer
I expanded on my knowledge of HTML and CSS by learning how to create more interactive and functional webpages using backend PHP, frontend Javascript, 
and database management.

The final project in this class had to involve all programming languages we learned throughout the course to create a functional and useful website. My partner Justin 
and I created a website to play the Speed card game using Javascript. It featured functional logins and profiles, an admin system, an elo leaderboard, match histories, 
and a working replay system! This was probably my favorite project I've done at ATDP!
