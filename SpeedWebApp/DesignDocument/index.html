        <h1>Design Document: Elo/Matchmaking system (Speed Card game)</h1>
        <p>
            Speed is a 2 player card game. To store our data we use 2 tables and
            1 junction table. USER contains user information, MATCH contains
            per-match information, and the junction table helps match users with
            friends.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            However, the baseline for our project will be the
            elo/profile/friends system driving our (hopefully in the future)
            speed implementation. The details of columns in the Match table are
            all very dependent on how far we go, and mostly just serve to
            document ideas.
        </p>
        <h2>Database ERA</h2>
        <img src="DB_ERA.png" alt="Database ERA" />
        <h2>Adjustments to Database ERA</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>instead of player 1 and player 2 elochanges and id's, we use host and guest players to distinguish the two. Host players log in first, and are used for profile.php's default user and friends system.</li>
          <li>removed fname and lname for the user since it's not necessary.</li>
          <li>USER table now has rating and rd. We know this is duplicate data because elo changes are already in the MATCH table but dev said it was good for reducing the number of sql statements.</li>
          <li>match_outcome is now just the winner's id. if it is 0, the game is a draw.</li>
          <li>password hash is stored in the user table. don't know how we forgot that one.</li>
          <li>friends table distinguishes player1 and player2 with requester and requestee.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Webpages List:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                /play.php - Card game UI where two players can log in and play a
                frontend game of speed. POSTs to /submit-play.php where the
                result is logged in the database and ratings are adjusted.
            </li>
            <li>
                /search.php?query=string - Search for a specific player in the
                database. always require a search form at the top of every page
                that actions to here.
            </li>
            <li>
                /profile.php?id=int - view the profile of a player. This
                includes their username, their full name, their mutual friends
                with the viewer, non-mutual friends, and match history. this
                also has way to request a friend, or remove a friend if they already are one. This also includes form controls for only admins to submit, that lets them remove a user, edit a username, and add a match.
            </li>
            <li>
                /match.php?id=int - view a specific match, which contains stats
                on the elo and elo changes of the players, mistake count, etc. Includes a link to a match replay.
            </li>
            <li>
                /leaderboard.php - a leaderboard ordered by the ratings of the players, with links to each of their profiles.
            </li>
            <li>
                /replay.php?id=int - replays a match on the front end using the id given. Uses the match_events and deck_order in the database to generate and play a match.
            </li>
            <li>
                /sources.php - links to all external sources used in the project.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Flowchart Modifications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>instead of friends and profile being separate pages, they are combined into profile, so everything flowing into and out of friends should be going into and out of profile. </li>
          <li>match.php now also links to replay.php?id=int, which searches the match DB Table to run a replay of the game.</li>
          <li>All pages have links to play, leaderboard, profile, search, and login/logout through the header included in all pages.</li>
          <li>player1 and player2 are replaced with host and guest for extra distinction.</li>
          <li>submit-match now also updates the rating and rd in the user table, following advice from dev.</li>
